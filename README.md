ðŸ¥‡ Top fan of ðŸ“š libgen ðŸ“š

These are some textbooks that I've liked. For learning new topics and self-studying I find that a slightly informal tone with a bit of rambling and several exercises works best for me. On the other hand, references here will usually be bricks.
| Book shelf | Authors | Comments   |
|---------:|-----| --------|
| Understanding Regression Analysis: A Conditional Distribution Approach| Arias and Westfall| Just so clear and simple. |
|The Elements of Statistical Learning |Friedman, Tibshirani, and Hastie| nice reference (although I prefer ISLR when first learning an idea)|
|Statistical Rethinking | McElreath | Practiced Stan with this. Refer to it every now and then. Helped me better understand deviance and entropy (among other things). Several examples have stuck with me.|
|Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R| Wood | Gam reference. Rigorous|
|Observation and Experiment: An Introduction to Causal Inference| Rosenbaum | Light survey of ideas used to establish causality|
