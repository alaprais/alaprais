🥇 Top fan of 📚 libgen 📚

These are some textbooks that I've liked. 
| Book shelf | Authors | Comments   |
|---------:|-----| --------|
| Advanced Data Analysis From an Elementary Point of View | Cosma Rohilla Shalizi |  Fanboying this one pretty hard atm. A bunch of useful practical ideas here for **modern** analysis. |
| Computer Systems: A Programmers Perspective     |  Bryant O'Hallaron   | Only worked through a couple chapters. Great material but I kept thinking _why am I doing this to myself_. C is pretty cool though.  |
| Understanding Regression Analysis: A Conditional Distribution Approach| Arias and Westfall| Clear and simple and not _overly_ old-school|
|The Elements of Statistical Learning |Friedman, Tibshirani, and Hastie| reference |
|Statistical Rethinking | McElreath | Pretty interesting. Haven't really found a need to integrate it into my workflow though. Maybe someday.|
|Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R| Wood | Gam reference|
|Observation and Experiment: An Introduction to Causal Inference| Rosenbaum | Light survey of causal ideas|
